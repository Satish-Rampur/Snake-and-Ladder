# Snake-and-Ladder

Welcome to the Snake and Ladder game! This is a simple implementation of the popular board game.

How to Play

The game is played by one or more players on a board consisting of a grid of squares. Each player starts at the bottom of the board and takes turns rolling a die to determine how many squares they move forward.
If a player lands on a square with the bottom of a ladder, they climb up to the top of the ladder. If they land on a square with the head of a snake, they slide down to the tail of the snake.
The first player to reach the final square at the top of the board wins the game.
